							<h4>How to improve your website SEO</h4>

						<div class="research-flip-box-back">
						<p>
						<a href="https://www.mtu.edu/umc/services/websites/seo/">Five Ways to improve your sites ranking (SEO)</a> has tips on improving SEO.<br>
						<b>1. Keywords/Keyword Phrases:</b> Identify and target a specific phrases or keywords on your website so that users can search those phrases/keywords
						   to find the webpage.<br>
						<b>2. Frequently Update Content:</b> Regularly updated content shows a sites relevancy, this means that search engines are also more likely to show your content
						   if it is updated over old websites that have not been updated.<br>
						<b>3. Metadata:</b> Is the textual description that a browser may use in your page search return.<br>
						<b>4. Have a link-worth site:</b> A website that is helpful, unbiased, and content rich is most likely to attract links from other websites thus improving search engine optimization
						   Using descriptive links can also add value to readers, including those with disabilities or users using screen readers.<br>
						<b>5. Use alt tags:</b> Always describe videos and images with alt tags (alternative descriptions). These allow search engines to locate your page.

							<h4>Factors you should know when choosing web-hosts</h4>
							<img src="Media/web hosting.jpg" class="research-images">
						</div>
						<div class="research-flip-box-back">
						<p><b>Reliability:</b> Checking a webhosts uptime will allow you to see how reliable the web-host is during peak hours and also holiday time. Services with a good uptime should
						   be able to keep up with heavy traffic and should not be at risk of going offline. This will ensure that your website is active as much as possible.<br>
						   <b>Hosting features:</b> Various web-hosts possibly have packages that could possibly add extra features that your businesses' website will need. For example:
						   if your website is an e-commerce website, you possibly could get an e-commerce sort of package that could include a shopping cart and a payment processor instead
						   of having to create it from scratch.<br>
						   <b>Security:</b> Having a web host that is secure means that your website is at a lower risk of being attacked. For example: If your website is one based on e-commerce,
						   this will mean that your web-hosts server will be holding information from your website. If you use a less secure web-host you may possibly suffer from attacks, or even information theft,
						   it is important to get a webhost with good security unless you really don't have the money for it.

						<p><b>5 Tips for reducing load speed</b><br>
							<b>1. Optimize your images:</b> different file formats have different sizes, if your website is experiencing low load times try changing the file type of some of your images.<br>
							<<b>2. Don't scale down your images:</b> if you scale down images within the code of a website, the website will try to scale it down as the page is loading, this will increace your
							load time as there is extra work being down as the page is being loaded.<br>
							<b>3. Put style sheet references at the top:</b> Placing your stylesheet references to the &lthead&gt of your HTML document help pages load faster because it allows your pages to render the styles
							progressively instead of right at the end.<br>
							<b>4. Put script references at the bottom:</b> scripts can be long and complicated functions that could take web browsers much longer to load that stylesheets, this can make website load times feel very long.
							Put script references at the bottom of the HTML document so the website loads the main parts of the website before it tries to load the functions.<br>
							<b>5. Use separate javascript and CSS files:</b> IF all the javascript and CSS for your website is within the HTML document, this will make the website load the css and functions every time the website loads.
							This will make the website feel like it's got a long load time. It is also neater and easier to use external files.<br>
							<b>5 things to do when maintaining a website</b><br>
							Make Regular backups of your site, Test Load Speed, Fix dead links and errors, Test Browser Compatibility and check search rankings.

							<h4>Web Security</h4>
							<img src="Media/cyber security.jpg" class="research-images">
						</div>
						<div class="research-flip-box-back">
						<p>
							<b>5 common cyber attack methods and preventatives:</b><br>
							<b>1. Password attacks:</b> If your website has some sort of authentication then password attacking could become a problem, a preventative for this type of attack is to have an account lockout
							e.g. lock the account after 5 failed password attempts.<br>
							<b>2. DDoS (Denial of Service) attacks:</b> A denial of service attack is aimed at denying anyone but the attacker access to the webpage in order to do some sort of harm to it or even theft. A
							 preventative of this type of attack is to use a proxy like cloudflare where they are able to withstand DDoS attacks because of their 5 second timer. This prevents the DDoS going to the desired website as they 
							 begin running as soon as it's started. Cloudflare adds a timer before the website is accessed, this means that the DDoS goes to cloudflare rather than your webserver.<br>
							 <b>3. Phishing attacks:</b> Phishing attacks are easily missed and easily avoided, however there are those people who miss the clear indicators of the attack and click on a link thinking it's for something else. 
							 The only way to prevent this is to regularly quiz people on phishing attacks and inform them on certain bits of content that indicate an attack attempt.<br>
							 <b>4. Ransomware:</b> Ransomware is everywhere on the internet from dodgey applications to malicious emails, ransomware can be used to hold a system "hostage". Preventatives for this type of attack would be 
								not open suspicious links, download from non reputable sources, make sure backups have been created almost daily if a roll back is needed etc.<br>
								<b>5: Cross site scripting :</b> Cross site scripting(XSS) occurs when an untrusted source is allowed to inject their own code into a web application and that dynamic code if includes with content delivered to the victims browser.  
								XSS allows an attacker to steal session cookies, allowing the attacker to pretend to be the user, however if can also be used to spread malware, deface websites and reate havoc on social networks. 
								Preventatives for this type of attack include; filtering ingress data, encoding egress data, and content security policies<br>
